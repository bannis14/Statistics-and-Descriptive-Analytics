# Diamond Price Analysis with Binary Linear Regression

This repository contains Python code for analyzing diamond prices using linear regression. It explores how the carat weight of diamonds influences their prices. Additional binary linear regression is also used to analyze if price is influeneced by comparing diamonds weight groupings above and below 0.6 carats.

## Overview

In this analysis, we utilized Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment, to perform binary linear regression on a dataset of diamond prices. The code is organized into two main sections:

1. **Linear Regression Analysis**: In this section, we initially perform a simple linear regression to understand the relationship between the carat weight of diamonds and their prices. The results of this analysis are displayed through summary statistics and a visual representation of the regression line.

2. **Binary Linear Regression**: The core of the analysis lies in the binary linear regression. We create a binary variable, 'carat_binary', which indicates whether a diamond is considered "large" (above 0.6 carats) or not. We then conduct binary linear regression to determine how this binary variable influences diamond prices. This is essential for understanding whether there's a significant difference in prices between these two categories.

## Requirements

To run the code in this analysis, you'll need:

- Access to Google Colab (no local installation required)
- A Google account

## Instructions

1. Open the Google Colab Notebook:

   - Click on the [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bannis14/Diamond_Pricing_Regression_Model/blob/main/Diamond_Pricing_Model.ipynb) badge to open the notebook in Google Colab.

2. Run the Cells:

   - Run the code cells in the notebook to perform the binary linear regression analysis.
   - Modify the notebook as needed for your dataset or analysis.

3. Interpret the Results:

   - Refer to the provided README or comments in the notebook for interpretations of the results.
