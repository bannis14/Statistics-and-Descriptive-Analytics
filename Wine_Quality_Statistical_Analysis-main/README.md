# Wine_Quality_Statistical_Analysis

This project analyzes the quality of wines using statistical methods and data visualization. It aims to understand the distribution of wine attributes, test for normality, compute standard errors, and calculate confidence intervals.

## Data Preparation

The project starts by loading the wine quality data from a CSV file. It examines the dataset's structure, data types, and checks for missing values. Unwanted variables are removed, and categorical variables are transformed using one-hot encoding. Additionally, the age of the wines is calculated.

## Normal Distribution (Gaussian)

In this section, the distribution of specific wine attributes is visualized. The project explores whether these attributes follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution by checking how many observations fall within a certain number of standard deviations from the mean.

## Shapiro-Wilks Test

The Shapiro-Wilks test is applied to assess the normality of selected attributes. The test checks whether the data follows a normal distribution, and the results are displayed.

## Finding the Standard Error

Standard errors are computed using both built-in functions and manual calculations. The standard error of selected attributes is determined.

## Finding the Confidence Interval

Confidence intervals for the mean of specific attributes are computed, allowing us to estimate the range within which the population mean is likely to fall.
